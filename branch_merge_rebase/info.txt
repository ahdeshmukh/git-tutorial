Difference between branch and tag
Branches follow the commits and move along
Tags always stay on the same commit

git log --graph --oneline shows graph of the commits
git log --graph --oneline --all shows graph with all branches rather just the current one
git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate gives extra information by applying labels to the commits such as HEAD, tag, master etc..

Creating alias
git config --global alias.name "commands"
eg: git config --global alias.lga "log --graph --oneline --all --decorate"
after doing this, instead of issuing git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate, I can do git lga

Adding a branch
git branch branch_name

Getting to the branch
git checkout branch_name

Adding a branch and getting to it in one command
git checkout -b branchname

Git rename branch
git branch -m branchname new_branchname ( m => move )

Getting a deleted branch
Do git reflog
You will see the commit of the deleted branch before it was merged with master. Get the SHA number of the commit. Then do git branch branchname SHA

if you want to carry over stash to new branch, do git stash branch branchname
